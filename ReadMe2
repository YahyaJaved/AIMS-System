--> At home directory of dmsl, in ~/AIMS/Postgres-AIMS/src/backend/executor/execMain.c
commment out the following lines (already did that) and save the file

      1553 - 1583
      1607 - 1640
      1679 - 1686

--> Similarly at ~/AIMS/Postgres-AIMS/src/backend/executor/nodeModifyTable.c comment out the following
lines (already did that) and save the file.

      234 - 260
      526 - 556
      844 -870
      1101 - 1129

--> now while at Postgres-AIMS directory run the following commands

    -  ./ configure
    -  make
    -  sudo make install

--> now you can initiakize postgres data directory

--> Once postgres is running fine, then create log_table (ddl is given in /shared/aims/setup/create_table.sql)

--> Find out the OID of the log_table executing the following statement in psql

    - select oid from pg_class where relname= 'log_table';

--> Use this OID in line 1564 of ~/AIMS/Postgres-AIMS/src/backend/executor/execMain.c and lines 245 and 856 of
~/AIMS/Postgres-AIMS/src/backend/executor/nodeModifyTable.c and uncomment what you have commented before in these files.

--> Again run the following commands and you are good to go

    -  ./ configure
    -  make
    -  sudo make install
