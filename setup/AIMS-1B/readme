1] In order for the recovery system to work correctly the log_table and should be populated properly
2] even the inserts of the tuples should be in the log_table should be logged, the cleaning of the log_table after every experiment run can be
	done by " delete from log_table where operation <> 2; "
3] The backup_trigger_checking should be installed properly, for each update it logs the new and old balance with negligible overhead << verified >>
